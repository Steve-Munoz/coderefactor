EXPLANATION:

In order to make CSS and HTML more readable I replaced many non semantic tags in HTML file with with semantic tags, such as nav, main, figure, aside, and small. 
Changing these to semantic tags makes it easier to read a block of code. Your code can become cluttered especially in CSS where you can use different classes 
for certain elements, but they all have the same rules. This make for repititive and unecessary code. Once i added semantic tags in HTML I cleaned up CSS files 
by replacing the selectors with the semantic tags and deleting the other repititve selectors with the same rules. The website looks exactly the same, but 
the lines of code are much easier to read and less cluttered.
